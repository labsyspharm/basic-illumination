# Takes a filename pattern describing a list of image files and generates flat-
# and dark-field correction profile images with BaSiC. The pattern must contain
# a "*" wildcard to indicate the part of the filename that varies with the image
# series number. If the images are stored with one channel per file then the
# pattern must also contain the placeholder {channel} in place of the channel
# name or number. If the image files are multi-channel then the {channel}
# placeholder must be omitted. The output format is two multi-channel TIFF files
# (one for flat and one for dark) which is the input format used by Ashlar.

# Invocation for running from the commandline:
# (to match files like "s001_c1.tif", "s001_c2.tif", "s002_c1.tif", etc.)
